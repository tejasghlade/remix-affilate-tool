<!-- list of what things are done -->

- [x] 1. Create a new repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.
- [x] 2. Use port 3001 for the remix dev server.
- [x] 3. The referral payout (20%) should be a variable in the code that can easily be adjusted up or down.
- [x] 4. Take a 2% monthly churn rate into account on the total number of referred customers. This percentage should also be a variable in the code that can easily be adjusted up or down.
- [x] 5. All calculations should happen in the backend as we donâ€™t want to expose our billing logic and churn rate on the client side.
- [x] 6. When changing the sliders it should do a network request and display a loading indicator until the result is returned.
- [x] 7. The style should follow the reference image, you can find colors, typography and icons to use on https://sunvoy.com/branding.
- [x] 8. The project can be started using `npx run dev` and be accessed at `localhost:3001`.
- [x] 9. Everything is strongly typed using TypeScript and can be type checked.
- [x] 10. The frontpage loads the referral calculator.
- [x] 11. The design is responsive.
- [x] 12. The layout uses TailwindCSS for styling according to https://sunvoy.com/branding.
- [x] 13. The sliders can be adjusted by dragging the handles.
- [x] 14. The sliders use the correct min and max values.
- [x] 15. The sliders include tooltips where necessary.
- [x] 16. The number in the sliders adjusts when the sliders are dragged.
- [x] 17. When finishing adjusting the sliders a backend request is made.
- [x] 18. The calculations are handled on the backend and shipped to the frontend.
- [x] 19. There is a variable in code for referral payout rate (20%).
- [x] 20. There is a variable in code for churn rate (2% per month).
- [x] 21. A loading indicator using FontAwesome circle notch icon with a spinning animation is displayed.
- [x] 22. The total income adjusts according to the numbers passed to the backend and is properly calculated.
- [x] 23. The graph and its monthly value are properly calculated and adjust accordingly.
- [x] 24. The graph labels start in the current month.
- [x] 25. The graph labels display the month in three letters and the year only for the first value and when the year changes between one and another.
- [x] 26. The graph displays properly formatted dollar values for each month.
- [x] 27. The last graph month is highlighted.
- [x] 28. After successful implementation a quick screen recording via loom showing the feature in action is recorded and a link to the recording is added to the readme.md within the repository.

### Time Estimate

The estimated time to complete this assessment is approximately 4 to 4:30 hours, depending on familiarity with the technologies and the complexity of the implementation.
